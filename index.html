                         <strong>"Farzando ne thaali nai kari ? Farzando ne to pehla thaali jawu jove" </strong>(not exact alfaaz) - These were the kalemaat nooraniyah which wrote the destiny of FMB Poona Students.</p>
 
 <p>
     It was Poona Safar Mubarak of 1433 H, and Bawasaheb Moula Sayedna Mohammed Burhanuddin (RA), had graciously given Raza mubarak for a special qadambosi bethak for students. During this bethak the students did FMB niaz araz in Moulana (RA), with the niyat that we soon start receiving this azeem barkat.</p>
 
                 <p>
                     After the qadambosi of Burhanuddin Moula (RA), we proceeded to do the qadambosi of Sayedna Aaliqadr Moula (TUS). It was destined that we receive this barakaat of Burhanuddin Moula on the hands of His Mansoos. During qadambosi, Aaliqadr Moula asked a student if he received thaali, when the answer was not affirmative, Moula (TUS) gave the above irshaadaat.</p>
 
                 <p>Efforts were then made under the qiyadat of Shz Taha Bhaisaheb Najmuddin that the students themselves organize a Faiz, so that not only they receive the barakaat of thaali but also get involved in this azeem khidmat. For next three days Mufaddal Moula would say shifa on aata, out of which jaman was prepared and sent out to students in thaali. It was an ain Mojiza of both Moula that during the Safar Mubarak itself the thaali was organized and it started reaching students.</p>
 
                 <p>Its Moula's ehsaan that zabihats are provided every month from the khaas maal of Moulana (TUS) to every FMB globally. Moula shafaqat kari ne har mahina maa mumineen ne jamaare che. However for us this zabihat is much more special, for us the raza came on the night of 16th Rabi ul Awwal 1435 H. During His last night in this earthly abode, Burhanuddin Moula (RA) graced us with shafaqat which continues to flow today through aapna mansoos and jaanasheen Sayedna Mufaddal Saifuddin (TUS).</p>
 
                 <p>Come lets sip from this barakaat of both Moulas, lets eat every morsel and remember the shafaqat of Burhanuddin Moula (RA), and lets cherish each morsel and pray for a long life of his most precious gift - His Mansoos and our Bawasaheb Sayedna Abu Jafer us Saadiq Aaliqadr Mufaddal Saifuddin Moula (TUS).</p>

            <p class="text-info">What is Faiz ul Mawaid il Burhaniyah ?</p>
            <p>Faiz ul Mawaid il Burhaniyah is the faiz of our beloved Bawasaheb Moula<strong> Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin (RA)</strong> ane aapna noore nazar ane Mansoos
               <strong> Syedna Aali Qadr Mufaddal Saifuddin (TUS)</strong>.</p>
            <p>This faiz is in the tradition of Hudaat Kiraam feeding mumineen, just as <strong> Moulana Ali (AS)</strong> used to feed mumineen in Kufa through Imamain Aqdasain, today this barkaat flows to every mumin's home on the hands of his Dai.</p>
            <p class="text-info">How much is the hub ?</p>
            <p>The hub that you pay is for 'jamarwane'. It is the ehsaan of bawasaheb Moula that by giving hub we are able to get the sawaab of feeding mumineen every single day. The more hub you do araz, the more sawab of Itaam ut Ta'am (jaman jamarwanu). Let us know the hub you are willing to contribute.</p>
            <p>The hub is due on one of the specified miqaats.</p>
            <p>The hub is not for your thaali, you can never pay for the jaman, as Moula jamare che, it is for 'jamarwane'.</p>
            <p class="text-info">Who can register for students faiz, and why is it different from the local jamaat faiz ?</p>
            <p>Students faiz is for students or working professionals from outside Poona. If you are permanently settled in Poona or are a family, please contact your local faiz for starting a thaali and do not register here.</p>
            <p>Students faiz is a hasanat of Moula's (TUS) Poona safar mubarak in 1433 H. It was started to involve students in this azeem khidmat and also to cater specifically to their needs. Hence it is every student's Faiz, so please come forward with your views, feedbacks, and help in any kind to make this Faiz as per Moula(TUS)s wishes and gain His happiness.</p>
            <p class="text-info">How much is the quantity ?</p>
            <p>A thali consists of 5 rotis and tarkari, 1 container of rice and dal. If you need more/less quantity contact us. For a single person it provides sufficient quantity for two meals.</p>
            <p class="text-info">What are the pickup timings ?</p>
            <p>Pickup timings are between 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM</p>
            <p class="text-info">How and where can I pay the hub ?</p>
